To install all dependencies, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  
Required dependencies will be automatically installed if using pip as described in the next section.

# Installing

To install as a module:

    python3 setup.py install

You should be able to run Idle using `idlemp` or `python3 -m idlemp`.

Note: it can also be executed without installing with `python3 idlemp.py`.

# Running

Several command line arguments can be passed to `idlemp`.  
You can see a list of them by running `idlemp --help`.

Idle stores its downloaded audio files and its configuration files in the same directory.
The path to this directory is controlled by the `library_path` command line argument (by default, it's the current directory).

Logs are writtten to the `log.txt` file.  
Music information is stored in the `library.json` file.  
The autoplay schedule is read from the `schedule.json` file. See the `schedule.json.example` file for how to configure it.  
If present, the file specified by the `--urllist` argument, which should contain a list of URLs to musics (separated by newlines), will be used to download musics automatically.  
This file will be read periodically and downloaded URLs will be deleted.
